Short description

Library for creating deep catalogs copy on network workstations. Allows you to track the status of each job for a remote node.


Why is this needed if there are XCOPY/CP?

My library allows you to copy not only to a local disk on the current device, but also to copy to remote nodes in the network, checking the network status for each node separately. Also allows one command to copy files to multiple devices. And generate a report for each node.


Using

Example of using represented in the console application in project.
